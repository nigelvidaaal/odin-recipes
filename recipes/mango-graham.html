    <i>Mango graham cake is a popular dessert in the Philippines. Also called mango float, it’s cold, sweet and so easy to make. Just layer graham crackers, sweetened cream, mangoes and enjoy.</i>

        <h3> Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Heavy cream or whipping cream – you want to go with full fat (this means has fat content of at least 36%) because it whips better</li>
            <li>sweetened Condensed Milk</li>
            <li>Graham cracker cookies – I like using whole wheat because it has a nutty taste but you can use regular ones if you like</li>
            <li>Fresh, ripe mangoes</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>Directions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the cream, sweetened condensed milk and vanilla extract in a large bowl. Beat with a hand mixer until double in volume, about 4 minutes. </li>
            <li>Spread a scant 2 cups of cream in an 8-inch square baking dish, followed by 1/2 cup graham cracker crumbs and a third of the mangoes. Continue alternating layers for a total of 9 layers, ending with mango. Chill at least 8 hours and up to overnight. </li>
        </ol>
